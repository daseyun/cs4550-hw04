6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
medium. struggled a lot until it clicked. 

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Biggest hurdle for me was wrapping my head aroud to solve the problems recursively. 
case / cond was a little difficult to understand in the beginning. 
-> had no idea how to implement tag_token / infix_to_postfix until extensive playtesting in iex. 
(even though I understood the pseudocode)
being able to pattern match within the function's parameter's as well as pattern matching empty list 
was surprisingly confusing and undocumented.
